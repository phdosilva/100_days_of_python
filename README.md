# 100 Days of Python
Taking into account that to learn something you need spend time studying, I'm starting this project to learn a language and its applications little by little, but in a consistent way.

Despite my degree in computing, I'm a product person and today i have been developing codes just for my hobby. This project is algo an attempt to understand more about the technical world of development.

I met the 100 days code challenge years ago and as soon as I started studying this time, after the first 2 or 3 days looking for reference content, I found a course on Udemy called [100DaysOfPython](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) and decided to take the challenge along with the course.

I'm not starting from scratch because I've had contact with the language before. But now I'm starting from the basics as I never went deeper.

### Day 1
