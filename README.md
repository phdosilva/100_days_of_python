# 100 Days of Python
Taking into account that to learn something you need spend time studying, I'm starting this project to learn a language and its applications little by little, but in a consistent way.

Despite my degree in computing, I'm a product person and today i have been developing codes just for my hobby. This project is algo an attempt to understand more about the technical world of development.

I met the 100 days code challenge years ago and as soon as I started studying this time, after the first 2 or 3 days looking for reference content, I found a course on Udemy called [100DaysOfPython](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) and decided to take the challenge along with the course.

I'm not starting from scratch because I've had contact with the language before. But now I'm starting from the basics as I never went deeper.

### Day 1
- Before the challange, I was introduced to the basics of OOP, inheritance, _dunder methods_ and _duck typing_ on python;
- Started the [100DaysOfPython](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) Course from class 15, by test recommendation;

### Day 2
- Developed a coffee machine code;
- Reviewed the imperative code process;
- Equivalent to day 15, at the course;

### Day 3
- Manipulated classes and objects;
- Re implemented a coffee machine using ready-made classes;
- Equivalent to day 16, at the course;

### Day 4
- Created my own Class in Python;
- Added Methods to a Class;
- Equivalent to day 17, at the course;

### Day 5
- Trained to read documentation;
- Implemented new projects using the turtle library;

### Day 6
